    <div class="text"><h3>
       From the roots of a sibling rivalry PUMA, one of the most well-known German brand, was born. Founded in 1948, the world’s third largest sportswear brand was founded by Rudolf Dassler. Dassler first found notoriety in the sportswear world when he and his brother Adolf Dassler jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The 1928 Amsterdam Olympics saw most German athletes sporting Dassler spikes and American athlete Jesse Owens winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games in 1936 Berlin, all while sporting Dassler spikes. But the already fraught relationship between the two brothers deteriorated despite their success and the two agreed to split in 1948. They formed two separate entities, Adolf with adidas and Rudolf with PUMA.</h3></div>
